# WonRemote Incident Registry

Every production defect, installer failure, update failure, crash, or repeated user-visible malfunction must receive an entry before its fix is declared complete. Entries are append-only. A future change may add evidence or close a verification gap, but must not erase the original failure record.

## Required Entry Format

```text

## INC-20260812-001: Viewer update check failed in installed Viewer

- Detected: 2026-08-12.
- Severity: P1.
- Affected: installed Viewer `0.1.59` on Windows x64; manual and automatic update checks.
- Status: fixed-not-released.
- User-visible symptom: Manual update check displayed `Update check failed` because the installed WebView directly fetched the GitHub release manifest.
- Minimal trigger: Open an installed `0.1.59` Viewer and use its update-check control.
- Root cause: GitHub release-asset redirects do not provide a stable browser CORS contract. Separately, Tauri passed Windows verbatim (`\\?\\`) resource paths to bundled Node.js, which failed with `EISDIR`.
- Fix commit(s): `96ddc14`; `9e5a0b7`.
- Permanent guard: Installed Viewer checks use the native signed updater only; all Node-facing resource paths derive from `node_resource_paths`.
- Regression proof: `npm test -- src/desktopPackaging.test.ts src/agent/productionUpdateCheck.test.ts` and `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml test_node_resource_paths`.
- Release proof: `v0.1.60` GitHub Actions release workflow started; final published-asset verification remains required.
- Remaining blocker: Same-tag published assets and installed-runtime update verification are not yet confirmed.

## INC-20260816-001: Single-architecture release could regress x64 runtime and block cross-architecture reinstall

- Detected: 2026-08-16T08:05:42Z.
- Severity: P1.
- Affected: Viewer and Agent `0.1.60` release lane; Windows x64 and x86 installation/update paths.
- Status: fixed-not-released.
- User-visible symptom: A consolidated x86-only release would move x64 clients from native WebRTC to the x86 fallback, while a manual x64/x86 replacement could leave the previous process holding installer files.
- Minimal trigger: Publish one x86 payload for both architectures or install a different architecture over a running WonRemote product.
- Root cause and contributors: Public asset count was reduced by deleting the native x64 payload instead of wrapping both architectures; installer process cleanup also filtered targets by PE architecture.
- Fix commit(s): `5ab222d`.
- Permanent guard: Viewer and Agent each use a product-isolated universal NSIS wrapper with native x64/x86 payload selection; x86 packaging executes the bundled ia32 Node and `werift` smoke; installer cleanup stops every process under the exact product root regardless of architecture.
- Regression proof: `npm test -- src/desktopPackaging.test.ts src/domain/updateManifest.test.ts src/domain/updateManifestScript.test.ts src/domain/installerHookIsolation.test.ts src/agent/agentWebRtcRuntimeSmoke.test.ts src/agent/productionUpdateMetadata.test.ts src/agent/agentUpdateOnce.test.ts src/agent/productionInstallerUpdate.test.ts src/api/viewerUpdate.test.ts src/domain/versioning.test.ts scripts/build-backend.test.js scripts/package-release-exes.test.js` -> 12 files and 101 tests passed; four release scripts passed `node --check`; `git diff --check` passed. `0.1.61` built both architecture payloads and two universal wrappers; the signed manifest verified both universal assets, and x64 Viewer/Agent physical replacement preserved the Agent identity and runtime.
- Release proof: not released.
- Remaining blocker: Physical install/update verification on Windows x86 remains required before publishing.

## INC-20260816-002: x86 release build crashed before runtime smoke execution

- Detected: 2026-08-16T08:33:37Z.
- Severity: P1.
- Affected: `0.1.61` x86 release build; `scripts/build-backend.js` runtime smoke stage.
- Status: fixed-not-released.
- User-visible symptom: `npm run release:exes` stopped at the x86 Viewer build with `ReferenceError: ensureExists is not defined` after completing both x64 installers.
- Minimal trigger: Run an ia32 backend build without injecting a test-only `ensureFile` function.
- Root cause and contributors: The production default parameter referenced a nonexistent helper, while the original tests always injected a mock and never exercised the default path.
- Fix commit(s): `07a51e6`.
- Permanent guard: The smoke check now defaults to the real `ensureBuildArtifact` helper, and a temporary-files regression test invokes the production default without dependency injection.
- Regression proof: `npm test -- scripts/build-backend.test.js src/agent/agentWebRtcRuntimeSmoke.test.ts` -> 2 files and 5 tests passed; `node --check scripts/build-backend.js` and `git diff --check` passed. A clean `npm run release:exes` then completed x64 and x86 packaging in 512.96 seconds, including the bundled ia32 Node and `werift` runtime smoke.
- Release proof: not released.
- Remaining blocker: Windows x86 physical installation remains required before release publication.

## INC-20260816-003: Viewer replacement stopped the background Agent

- Detected: 2026-08-16T08:48:49Z.
- Severity: P1.
- Affected: `0.1.61` Viewer upgrade from an older installed Viewer while the Windows Agent is running.
- Status: fixed-not-released.
- User-visible symptom: A silent Viewer reinstall completed successfully but the Agent process disappeared and did not return.
- Minimal trigger: Start the installed Agent, then run the universal Viewer installer with `/S` over the existing Viewer.
- Root cause and contributors: The previously installed Viewer uninstaller still contained legacy cross-product process cleanup and could terminate the Agent during replacement. Product isolation in the new inner installer cannot change that already-installed uninstaller.
- Fix commit(s): `bce5194`.
- Permanent guard: The universal Viewer wrapper restarts an installed Agent after successful Viewer replacement without embedding or reinstalling the Agent payload; focused wrapper tests enforce both restart and product isolation. Wrapper-only assembly reuses already-built inner installers for fast validation.
- Regression proof: `npm test -- scripts/package-release-exes.test.js src/desktopPackaging.test.ts` -> 2 files and 56 tests passed. On Windows x64, silent Viewer replacement changed the running Agent PID from `3056` to `19296`, then kept exactly one Agent process running; Viewer and Agent both reported `0.1.61`, and device identity remained `123-45-67890:AGENT-82220F6D`.
- Release proof: not released.
- Remaining blocker: Windows x86 physical installation remains required before release publication.

## INC-20260816-004: Installer update could leave a partially replaced product without file rollback

- Detected: 2026-08-16T09:15:46Z.
- Severity: P1.
- Affected: installed Viewer and Agent updater handoff on Windows x64 and x86.
- Status: fixed-not-released.
- User-visible symptom: An installer failure or post-install runtime health failure could restart a partially replaced product instead of restoring the previous installation files.
- Minimal trigger: Start a verified installer update that either exits nonzero after changing files or exits zero while the replacement runtime cannot remain healthy.
- Root cause and contributors: The handoff treated process restart as rollback, had no pre-install product-root backup, and had no end-to-end fixture covering real file replacement and recovery.
- Fix commit(s): `3c055a2`.
- Permanent guard: The handoff completes a transactional product-root backup before stopping the old runtime, restores files on installer or health failure, retains backup files if restoration itself fails, and refuses to start installation without a complete backup. Local and CI publication also require the installer-update E2E and direct extraction of all four x64/x86 inner payload hosts.
- Regression proof: `npm test -- scripts/verify-universal-installer-payloads.test.js scripts/package-release-exes.test.js src/agent/productionInstallerUpdate.test.ts` -> 3 files and 14 tests passed. `npm run test:update-e2e` proved successful old-to-new replacement, nonzero installer rollback, post-install health rollback, and backup-unavailable refusal. `npm run release:verify-payloads` reproduced both universal wrappers and directly extracted all four inner installers to verify x64/x86 host PE machines.
- Release proof: not released; source build and version were intentionally unchanged.
- Remaining blocker: Build a new version and complete Windows x86 physical installation before publication.
